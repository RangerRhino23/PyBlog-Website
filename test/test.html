  <h1>Creating web applications with python flask.</h1><br>
  <h3>Difficulty: Intermediate</h3>


  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In this blog post we will be making a website with python and flask.
    and successfully running it a localhost.
  </p>

  <h2>What is flask?</h2>
  <p>
      Flask is a web framework for Python that allows you to develop web applications easily.
      It is a microframework that doesnâ€™t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.
      Flask provides only the essential components like routing, request handling, sessions, and so on. It provides you with libraries, tools,
      and modules to develop web applications like a blog (like this one), wiki,
      or even a commercial website.
  </p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    To get started with Flask, you will first need to install the Flask Library. To do this run the following command in a terminal:
  </p> 
  <br>
  <pre><code id="code-block-1" style="color: white;">pip install Flask
  </code>       <div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-1')"></div></pre>
  <br><br>
  <p>This will install all of the required stuff need to start working with Flask!</p>

  <h2>Building your first Website with Flask</h2>
  <p>
    Now that you have gotten Flask installed, you will need to make a project folder to store the python file as well as other files you will use later on.
    Once you have your folder created, open in your code editor or IDE. In that folder, create a new file and name it 'main.py'. Make sure you have the .py on the end.
    In the newly created file put the following code:
  </p>
  <br>
  <pre><code id="code-block-2" style="color: white;">from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
  return 'This is my first website!'

app.run('localhost', 5000)
  </code>                   <div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-2')"></div></pre>
  <br><br>
  <p>
    Running the code above will create a 'website' on the url 'http://localhost:5000'. (To run the file, open file explorer and double click on the file and it should
    open a terminal running the file) Now go to your web browser and in your url search bar, put:
  </p>
  <br>
  <pre><code id="code-block-3" style="color: white;">http://localhost:5000
  </code>         <div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-3')"></div></pre>
  <br><br>
  <p>If you did everything correctly, the webpage should look like this!</p><br>
  <img src="Flask-stuff/first-website-result.webp" class="img-preset" alt="First website result">
  <br>
  <p>
    Now you're thinking, how do you create proper websites with it because just adding
    text surely is that great. And you'd be right it isnt that great so to compensate flask allows
    you to use html files to display the website which is also why its known as a server sided module
    which means you can also use PHP and other server sided stuff.
  </p>
  <h2>Creating a HTML file</h2>
  <p>
    You can create a html file and call it whatever you'd like. In this blog we will be calling it:
    "test.html"
  </p>
<br>
<pre><code id="code-block-4" style="color: white;">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en">&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  This is HTML
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>                                       <div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-4')"></div></pre>
  <br><br><P>
    Using that code you can create a proper HTML layout that a web browser will be able to render 
    fully. And now we are going to make some modifactions to the python file to allow for HTML files to be used.
  </P><br><br>
  <pre><code id="code-block-5" style="color: white;">from flask import Flask, render_template
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder="static", template_folder="HTML")
  </code>                                     <div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-5')"></div></pre>
  <br><br>
  <p>
    In this modified version of the code it allows us to use the "render_template" that
    comes with flask. We are also settings a directory of our HTML files which will be called "HTML"
    so make sure to create a folder called "HTML" for flask to register the HTML files. We can now implement
    the HTML into flask so it can render it with the following code:
  <br><br></p>
  <pre><code id="code-block-6" style="color: white;">@app.route("/")
    def index():
        return render_template('test.html')
        </code>                         <div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-6')"></div></pre>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          So now when we run flask on the index page "/" it will render the "test.html" file 
          and display it on your localhost.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>In conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          Python's web framework, flask is a very powerful tool that can allow for server-sided 
          websites which can allow you to use services such as PHP to send and make requets but flask
          is good just for hosting a simple and easy website on your localhost network (Portforwarding can open it
          publicly). It is very good for beginners and even advanced users.

          But that is flask and we hope you enjoyed this blog!
        </p><br>
        <h3>FaQ</h3>
        <p>
          &bullet; Localhost can only be run within your network<br>
          &bullet; Flask is for python only but can render .html files<br>
          &bullet; The "5000" is the port number and can be anything from 1-65535<br>
          &bullet; If your flask fails change the port number<br>
          &bullet; Portforwarding can allow others to connect to your flask website.
