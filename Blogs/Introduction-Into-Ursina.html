    <h1>Introduction into Ursina!</h1>
    <h3>Difficulty: Beginner</h3>

    <p>
      If you're looking for an easy-to-use and beginner-friendly game engine, Ursina might be just what you need. Ursina is a Python-based game engine that was created with simplicity 
      and ease of use in mind. It's designed to help game developers quickly create 2D and 3D games without the need for complex coding or technical knowledge.
      In this blog post, we'll introduce you to Ursina, including its features, benefits, and how you can get started with it.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Features of Ursina</h2>
    <p>
      <b>3D Graphics</b> - Ursina is a 3D game engine that offers high-quality graphics and animations. It supports a wide range of 3D models, textures, and lighting options, allowing 
      developers to create visually stunning games.<br><br>
      <b>Easy-to-use</b> - Ursina is designed to be easy to use, even for beginners. Its simple syntax and intuitive interface make it easy to create games without the need for 
      extensive coding or technical knowledge.<br><br>
      <b>Built-in Components</b> - Ursina comes with a range of built-in components that help speed up game development. These include physics engines, audio systems, and input handling.<br><br>
      <b>Cross-Platform Support</b> - Ursina is a cross-platform game engine that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.<br><br>
      <b>Python-based</b> - Ursina is built on top of the Python programming language, which is known for its simplicity and ease of use. This means that developers can use Python to create 
      games without having to learn a new language.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Getting started with Ursina</h2>
    <p>
      To get started with Ursina, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can download and install Ursina by running the following command:
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre><code id="code-block-1" style="color: white;">pip install ursina
    </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-1')"></div></pre>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      After installing Ursina, you can start creating your first game. Ursina offers a range of tutorials and documentation to help you get started. You can find 
      these resources on the official Ursina website <a href="https://www.ursinaengine.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Setting up your first project</h2>
    <p>Setting up a new Ursina Project is super easy and quick. Here is a simple step by step guide:<br><br>
      1. Create a folder you want to store the Python file as well as any assets (images, models, etc.) you want to use.<br><br>
      2. Open that folder in an IDE of your choice. Visual Studio code is a very simple easy to use editor for coding.<br><br>
      3. Create a new file. You can name this anything you want just make sure it has ".py" at the end. For this tutorial I am going to put "main.py".
      (Note: If you havn't install Python yet, you will need to download and install that. You can find a guide <a href="Installing-Python" target="_blank">here</a>)<br><br>
      4. Time to start coding. In that new python file you created put the following code:
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre><code id="code-block-2" style="color: white;">from ursina import *

app = Ursina()

circle = Entity(model='circle', color=color.red)

app.run()
    </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-2')"></div></pre>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>5. Run the python file! You can do this by clicking a run button in your IDE or by running it through your terminal. To run it from a terminal, open up file explorer and find the folder
      you put your python file. Double click on the file and if you installed Python correctly, it should open a window with a red circle on it!
      Congrats! You created your first project with Ursina!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Ursina is a beginner-friendly and easy-to-use game engine that offers a range of features for creating 2D and 3D games. Its simple syntax and built-in components make it an ideal choice 
      for indie developers or small studios who are just starting with game development. With cross-platform support and a range of tutorials and documentation available, getting started with 
      Ursina is easy and accessible to anyone interested in creating their own games. If you are looking for more projects you can create using Ursina, check out other Ursina blogs on Pyblog!
