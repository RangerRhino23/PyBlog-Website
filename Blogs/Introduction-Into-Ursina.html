    </p>

    <h2>Getting started with Ursina</h2>
    <p>
      To get started with Ursina, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can download and install Ursina by running the following command:
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre><code id="code-block-1" style="color: white;">pip install ursina
    </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-1')"></div></pre>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      After installing Ursina, you can start creating your first game. Ursina offers a range of tutorials and documentation to help you get started. You can find 
      these resources on the official Ursina website <a href="https://www.ursinaengine.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Setting up your first project</h2>
    <p>Setting up a new Ursina Project is super easy and quick. Here is a simple step by step guide:<br><br>
      1. Create a folder you want to store the Python file as well as any assets (images, models, etc.) you want to use.<br><br>
      2. Open that folder in an IDE of your choice. Visual Studio code is a very simple easy to use editor for coding.<br><br>
      3. Create a new file. You can name this anything you want just make sure it has ".py" at the end. For this tutorial I am going to put "main.py".
      (Note: If you havn't install Python yet, you will need to download and install that. You can find a guide <a href="Installing-Python" target="_blank">here</a>)<br><br>
      4. Time to start coding. In that new python file you created put the following code:
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre><code id="code-block-2" style="color: white;">from ursina import *

app = Ursina()

circle = Entity(model='circle', color=color.red)

app.run()
    </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-2')"></div></pre>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>5. Run the python file! You can do this by clicking a run button in your IDE or by running it through your terminal. To run it from a terminal, open up file explorer and find the folder
      you put your python file. Double click on the file and if you installed Python correctly, it should open a window with a red circle on it!
      Congrats! You created your first project with Ursina!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Ursina is a beginner-friendly and easy-to-use game engine that offers a range of features for creating 2D and 3D games. Its simple syntax and built-in components make it an ideal choice 
      for indie developers or small studios who are just starting with game development. With cross-platform support and a range of tutorials and documentation available, getting started with
