    <h1>An introduction to pyweek</h1>
    <h3 id="Date">blank</h3>
    <script src="date.js"></script>
    <p>
      First let's start off by explaining what pyweek is.<br>Pyweek
      is a bi-annual (twice a year) event that is held by the current
      developers/maintainers of python, pyweek allows users to create 
      a game based of the winning catergory that the contenders choose.
      There are usually 5 catergories that the contenders can pick from. In pyweek35,
      the pyweek myself and RangerRhino took part in, the choices were as follows:<br><br>
      &bullet;In the shadows<br>
      &bullet;Las Vegas Nights<br>
      &bullet;Mass-produced<br>
      &bullet;Left, right, down<br>
      &bullet;Re-entry <br><br></p>
      <h3>Mine and RangerRhino's entry</h3>
      <p>
      and after casting out votes and waiting for the voting to end the
      victorious catergory was In the shadows which lead to us making Echoes in the Dark
      which lead to us getting 2.9/4 and scoring quite well. And we will
      be part-taking in the next pyweek</p>

      <h3>How to sign up.</h3>

      <h3>Engines you can use.</h3>
      <p>
        There are a lot of engines you can use when developing a game for pyweek, some of the 
        most popular are:<br><br>
        &bullet; Pygame<br>
        &bull; Ursina<br>
        &bull; Panda3D<br><br>
        And loads more <strong>Be careful when using different engines as they may not be supported.</strong>
        But other than that you can create anything you want, thats in line with the rules.
      </p>
      <h3>Side notes</h3><p>
        Some side notes include<br><br>
        - Making sure you plan your game out<br>
        - Voting for a catergory<br>
        - If you have assets before pyweek has started make sure to link them<br>
        - Have fun<br>
      </p>

      <h3>In conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Pyweek is one of the biggest python game jams out there hosted
        by the offical maintainers of python and the offical python discord server.
        Pyweek has been going on 17 and a half years (Thats 2005!) and continues to be held twice a
        year to this day. Have fun programming!
