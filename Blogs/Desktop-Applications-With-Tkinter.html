    <h1>Desktop Apps with Tkinter!</h1>
    <h3>Difficulty: Beginner</h3>
    <h3>Edited: 05/05/2023</h3>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Desktop applications can be an incredibly useful tool for a variety of purposes, from creating custom data visualizations to building applications that automate repetitive tasks. 
      One of the most popular ways to build desktop applications is with the Python programming language, and one of the most commonly used libraries for building desktop applications in Python is Tkinter.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started with Tkinter</h2>
    <p>
      To get started with Tkinter, you'll need to make sure that you have Python installed on your computer. If you know how to install Python, you can download Python from the official website 
      <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>or you can follow a step by step guide <a href="Installing-Python">here</a> <br>

      Once you have Python installed, you'll need to install Tkinter. Tkinter is included with most Python installations, but if you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip, the Python 
      package manager. To install Tkinter, open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command: <code>pip install tkinter</code> Once you have Tkinter installed, you're ready to start building your desktop application!
    </p>

    <h2>Creating a basic user interface</h2>
    <p>
      The first step in building a desktop application with Tkinter is to create a user interface. To create a user interface, you'll use Tkinter's built-in widgets, which are the visual elements that make up your application's interface.
      Let's start by creating a basic window. In your Python script, import the Tkinter module and create a new window using the Tk() constructor:
    </p>
    <br><br><pre><code id="code-block-1" style="color: white;">import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

root.mainloop()
      </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-1')"></div></pre><br><br>
      <p>
        This will create a new window, but it won't have any content yet. To add content to your window, you'll need to add widgets. Let's add a label widget to the window:
      </p>
      <br><br><pre><code id="code-block-2" style="color: white;">import tkinter as tk

root = tk.tk()

label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, world!")
label.pack()

root.mainloop()
      </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-2')"></div></pre><br><br>
    <p>  
      This will add a button to the window that says "Click me!".
    </p>

    <h2>Adding functionality</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you have a basic user interface, you can start adding functionality to your application.
      Let's say you want the button to do something when it's clicked. To do this, you'll need to add a function that will be called when the button is clicked:
    </p>
    <br><br><pre><code id="code-block-3" style="color: white;">import tkinter as tk

def button_click():
    print("Button clicked!")
    
root = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, world!")
label.pack()

button = tk.Button(root, text="Click me!", command=button_click)
button.pack()

root.mainloop()
    </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-3')"></div></pre><br><br>
    <p>  
      This will print "Button clicked!" to the console when the button is clicked.
      You can add more functionality to your application by adding more widgets and functions. For example, you could add an entry widget to allow the user to enter text, 
      or a canvas widget to display graphics.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In this blog post, we've covered the basics of building a desktop application with Tkinter. We've shown you how to create a basic user interface, add widgets to the interface, 
      and add functionality to your application.
      Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to building desktop applications with Tkinter. There are many more widgets and features that you can use to create 
      more complex and feature-rich applications. But hopefully, this post has given you a good starting point to build upon. Building desktop applications with Tkinter can be a fun and 
      rewarding experience. With a little bit of practice, you can create powerful and versatile applications that can be used for a wide range of tasks. So why not give it a try and see what you can create?

    window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
    
    var button = document.querySelector('[onclick="copyCode(\'' + elementId + '\')"]');
    button.classList.add('clicked');
    setTimeout(function() {
      button.classList.remove('clicked');
    }, 2000);
