  <h1>Making Web Games with Tapair.</h1><br>
  <h3>Difficulty: Beginner</h3>


  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    There are many different ways to create a working game on the web. You could use a website like Scratch that uses code blocks to
    create the game or you could code one using text coding like JavaScript. Although there are many different ways, 
    Taptapir is in my opinion one of the easier ones to learn and has tons of built in features that make creating games so much easier.
    <br><br>
    In this blog post, we will take a closer look at Taptapir and explore some of its features. 
    We will also provide some examples of Taptapir code and discuss its potential applications.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Taptapir?</h2>
  <p>
    Taptapir is a new programming language created by Pokepetter. 
    It is a compiled language that runs in the browser and transpiles into JavaScript. 
    Taptapir is a statically typed language with indentation-sensitive syntax, meaning that the 
    indentation of your code determines the structure of your program. This makes Taptapir code 
    more readable and easier to write. Taptapir is also significantly faster than Python, making 
    it a good choice for performance-critical applications.
    <br><br>
    The super useful thing about Taptapir is that its coded in a syntax like Python. It uses syntax
    like Ursina which is a game engine for Python also created by Pokepetter.
  </p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    To get started with Taptapir, first create a project folder. This is where all the code for your game will be stored.
    Inside of your project folder, create a new file called <i>game.html</i>. Once you have that file created, open that folder in your IDE or editor of choice.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing required Taptapir Files</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike Urisna and Python, Taptapir can't be installed using pip. To install Taptapir, you will have to download its required sorce code from github. To do this,
    open a command terminal in your project folder. In the terminal, run the following command:
  </p>
  <br><pre><code id="code-block-1" style="color: white;">git clone https://github.com/pokepetter/taptapir.git --depth=1
  </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-1')"></div></pre><br><br>
  <p>
    This should create a folder inside of your project folder called "taptapir".
  </p>

  <h2>Creating a blank scene</h2>
  <p>
    Now that you've installed taptapir, you can start to create your web game. In the html file you created earlier, put the following code:
  </p>
  <br><pre><code id="code-block-2" style="color: white;">
  </code><div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-2')"></div></pre><br><br>

  <script>
  function copyCode(elementId) {
    var codeBlock = document.getElementById(elementId);
    var range = document.createRange();
    range.selectNode(codeBlock);
    window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
    window.getSelection().addRange(range);
    document.execCommand("copy");
    window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
    
    var button = document.querySelector('[onclick="copyCode(\'' + elementId + '\')"]');
    button.classList.add('clicked');
    setTimeout(function() {
      button.classList.remove('clicked');
    }, 2000);
  }
