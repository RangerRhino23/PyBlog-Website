# Animations
when hovering over the buttons, going from left to right the animation
looks really smooth but going from right to left it looks really choppy
so if there was a way to do something about that, it'd be awesome (idk how to.)

# Bugs
Back to top button not big - DONE
Home-Mobile Blog Slider button moves the "camera" down when switching between sets of blogs - Couldn't Replicate more than a few times - This happens on main site too, the main reason i can think of is that when there are 3 blogs on the next page and 6 on the current one the page is longer and then gets shorter then longer etc.
